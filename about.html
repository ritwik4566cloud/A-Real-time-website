    <h1>Meet <span class="highlight">Swagata</span> üå∏</h1>
    <p>
      Meet Swagata ‚Äì IIT Madras‚Äô most unpredictable export since the monkeys in Himalaya hostel learned to open Maggi
      packets.

      He walks into class like he invented the syllabus, but sleeps like he‚Äôs allergic to PowerPoint. Professors fear
      two things: surprise audits and Swagata‚Äôs counter-questions.

      Swagata once missed a quiz, claimed it was a social experiment on academic resilience, and somehow got extra
      credit.

      He runs on caffeine, sarcasm, and random Wikipedia rabbit holes at 3 AM. His sleep cycle is governed by
      Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs alarm clock ‚Äì he might be asleep, awake, or both until observed.

      Swagata's laptop crashes only when he opens his placement resume. His idea of cloud storage is emailing stuff to
      himself with the subject line "pls don't forget this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hostel, his room is a perfect example of entropy in action. Even Google Maps can't find the floor of his
      room.

      He once entered Shaastra hackathon without a team, came out with a product, a sponsor, and five confused teammates
      who just wanted free t-shirts.

      If Swagata had a tagline, it‚Äôd be:
      <span class="highlight">‚ÄúLow attendance, high impact.‚Äù</span>.
